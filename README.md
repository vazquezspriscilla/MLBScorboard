ESPN Web Developer Code Project

Welcome to my page! I am excited to share my project with you all. Of course I never truly feel like I am done with a project, I always feel there is something to improve and a new feature to add. But I have to learn when to step away while everything is still working. I was a little overwhelmed at first with the amount of data I had recieved. I was not sure if I should just dump all  of the data back out into a table which would be easy enough but I wanted to keep it simple while showing off some of my capabilities. I will be more than happy to answer any questions about any of the code or my knowledge set.

I did have to run this on a localhost to avoid Cross Origin Errors with the AngularJS. 

Thanks again for this opportunity.
